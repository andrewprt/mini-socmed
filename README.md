Technologies used:
- React.JS
- react-router
- react-redux
- material-ui

API:
http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
This is a fake API. So all transactions like view/edit/delete may be have success responses, but in reality it's not edited.

What's lacking:
- aesthetics
- data model may be not perfect
- code cleaness
- comments in the source code
